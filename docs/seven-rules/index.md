## Motivation
After developing several years in different companies I've seen some common mistakes on myself and my colleges, during years I've been improving my code quality and speed by following a few principles 
that with time I've decided to officialize with an structured rule book. As any rule book I it's too long lost it's original purpose by increasing complexity, I've tried to keep it short and direct
in order to make it easy to remember.

## The rules
1. [Avoid "The magic"] (rule1 "Avoid 'The magic'")
2. Limit dependencies
3. Runaway from consultant style
4. Be straightforward 
5. Choose stateless over stateful
6. Don't be naive
7. One rule to rule them all: there is no absolute rule
