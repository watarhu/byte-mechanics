## Motivation
After developing several years in different companies I've seen some common mistakes on myself and my colleges, during years I've been improving my code quality and speed by following a few principles 
that with time I've decided to officialize with an structured rule book. As any rule book I it's too long lost it's original purpose by increasing complexity, I've tried to keep it short and direct
in order to make it easy to remember.

## The rules
1. [Avoid \"The magic\"](rule1.md "Rule1: Avoid \'The magic\'")
2. Limit dependencies
3. Runaway from consultant style
4. Be straightforward 
5. Choose stateless over stateful
6. Don't be naive
7. One rule to rule them all: there is no absolute rule
